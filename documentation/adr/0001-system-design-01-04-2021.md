# System design

## Context and Problem Statement
Based on the use cases, what should be the overall architecture of the software?

## Decision Drivers
* extensibility with new connectors
* separate evolvability of domain model and individual connectors

## Decision Outcome
Connectors have to inherit from an abstract connector. If the domain model evolves, the abstract connector provides a default implementation for the new stuff. A new connector inherits the default implementations for everything and just adds the stuff it wants to provide at the start. User has to provide the connector to use as well as a configuration file for it, so the connector does not have to handle configuration itself.

The connector is injected with interfaces so the connector can set a topic as well as trigger that changes are detected and pushed to the backend. This allows the connector to wait continuously and detecting changes and forwarding them to the backend in a regular interval.

Whenever the change detection is run, the algorithm runs in turn the individual pieces from the connector. These pieces compare their model to the domain model and emit object events to rectify any differences. Those object events are applied to the domain model in the system and sent to the backend as well.

The backend connection is configured separately, so it can evolve separately as well. 

Functionality required by all connectors, e.g. creating / finding topics and their ids, is provided by the application.
