# Use Cases

## Adding new connectors with existing project software
Lower the bar as much as possible for adding new connectors in the future. Basically, if a new connector can connect with the existing project software, the new connector does not have to transfer the whole domain model. Instead, it can start with basic stuff and transfer more parts later on.

## Offer smooth upgrade path for new connectors
The connectors and the domain model should be able to evolve at a different speed. If the domain model extends with new capabilities, no connector should have to be updated. If a new way to connect with the backend is added, no connector should have to be updated.

## Connectors can choose between setting up their backend DB from scratch or updating it
A connector should be able to run continuously and push changes from their project software to the backend. Likewise, a connector should be able to start, discover changes from the last start time and push those changes to the backend as well.
